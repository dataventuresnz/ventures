# All-of-government business register

Businesses find it a burden have to enter the same data multiple times for different government agencies.

Public agencies don't have the most up-to-date data for businesses, as the data's scattered across agencies.

**Concept** 

Creating an all-of-government, up to date business register that lowers data requirement burdens on businesses.
