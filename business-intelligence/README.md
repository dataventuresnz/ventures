# Business intelligence for retail and hospitality businesses

**Problem** 

Retail and hospitality businesses that are looking for a physical location don't often have the data to identify the best place to set up.

They may also not know of available properties in the best areas.

**Concept** 

A tool that helps businesses find the best available place to set up shop.
