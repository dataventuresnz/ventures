# Caller ID for registered companies

**Problem**

As a customer want to be reassured that whenever I receive a phone call from an organisation with whom I have a relationship it is the actual organisation calling me rather than a scam.

As a consumer-facing company we want to ensure our customers know it is us calling rather than a scam so we can save on time spent contacting customers and avoid the need for call backs.

**Concept**

Use 'over-the-top' content via the call originator official app (e.g. mobile banking) to notify users of an upcoming call. Alternatively use a messaging/calling functionality built into the app to make the secure call (this requires a smartphone and installed app).
