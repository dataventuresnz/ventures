# Data science brokering

Small agencies have problems they're trying to solve that would benefit from data science. Some don't know about the value data science might add. The problems may also be too small to go through a procurement process.

Recent data science graduates don't have opportunities for practical experience around their theoretical knowledge, and some may get out of practice with recently learned skills.

**Concept** 

For agencies: Dip your toes into the benefits of data science.

For grads: gain real-world experience in solving problems with data science.
