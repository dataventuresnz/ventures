# Dynamic rates/levies

**Problem** 

Retail tenants are often affected by unforeseen/unplanned circumstances or planned infrastructure upgrades/changes. This can be anything from an earthquake, a shopping centre opening up nearby or a roading/transport change.

These cause a change in the opportunity market for the retailers, and could be the difference between surviving or closing due to high rental prices. This is true even in cases where (if only temporarily) the changes mean it's no longer high street retail.

**Concept** 

Using relevant business performance data to help adjust and set council rates more fairly for businesses.
