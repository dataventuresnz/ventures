# Standard for accounts

**Problem** 

Business advisors/accountants and their clients use their own codings of how money is used in a business.

This means a business advisor/accountant can't get an overarching look into the way their various clients file their activities. This problem doesn't exist at a local environment level, but a regional and national view.

**Concept** 

Creating a common description for business activities across different accounting software packages to enable better insights into your finances.
