# Stats NZ Assurance

**Problem**

It's impossible to get 100% of data relating to a topic, meaning there's gaps in the data leading to inaccuracies.

Rarely is it clear what the indicator of the error in data being used behind reports/outputs/insights being generated by organisations. This means any outputs from organisations being used by others are affected heavily if these errors are high and undisclosed, especially if critical decisions are being made off of them.

**Concept**

A fluid audit process, where organisations producing any statistical outputs generate a score of confidence behind what they're releasing, including ways they could improve their approaches.
