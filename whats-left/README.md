# Whatsleft - Cash flow as a service

**Problem**

Small businesses - eg sole proprietors, partnerships - don't have a real-time image of their true available funds: the GST they owe after income and expenses, and what their accurate, real-time available funds are.

**Concept**

Personal finance management (PFM) for small businesses, giving a real-time picture of their GST commitments and what funds they truly have available.

No accountants needed (for your GST)!
